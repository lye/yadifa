     * There are two ideas behind the thread_pool
     *
     * _ The thread are launched once so using
     *   a thread is "instant" (about 0.00001 s)
     *
     * _ The tasks can be associated to a counter
     *   so we know exactly how much of these are
     *   running.  Some thread are "irrelevant" for
     *   our concurrence issues (axfr, ixfr)
     *
     *   We just have to have a counter on relevant
     *   threads so we know when we are able to update
     *
     *   NOTE: I actually do not know how many are
     *   scheduled so I could add this in the counter
