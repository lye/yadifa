 * The maximum number of nodes I should ever require is the queue size + 1
 *
 * A good way to handle this is :
 *
 * Node allocator, node destroyer
 *
 * But the node allocator only allocates a node if none are free
 * And the node destroyer does not release a node but queue it instead.
 *
 * If I enforce the requirement that the allocation/destruction is done
 * by a single thread I could gain some cpu cycles.
 *
 * This reasoning is also valid for the thread_pool_task
