 *  @brief Hash-Table of Balanced trees structure and functions.
 *
 *  Implementation of the Hash-Table of Balanced trees structure and functions.
 *  An hashtable holding htbt collections.
 *
 *  The idea behind this structure is that, although balanced trees are FAST,
 *  the deeper, the slower they are.
 *
 *  Another important thing is that btrees are accessed by a hash and thus, can collide.
 *
 *  This structure is thus used for the top-level balanced tree in order to
 *
 *  _ divide the top-level domains into smaller, faster trees.
 *  _ reduce the number of potential collisions in said trees.

     * This macro is the transformation on the hash to distribute the collided hashes

     * 
     * To work as intended (potentially split collisions) it has to be generated with
     * another formula than the one used for the BT.
     * 
     * The idea is:
     * 
     * H(x)  = H(y) => collision
     * h(x) != h(y) => no collision anymore
     * 
     * h(x) must not be a function of H(x)
